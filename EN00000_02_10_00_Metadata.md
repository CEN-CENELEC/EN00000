Introduction
------------

The following draft describes how metadata of open-source projects can
be delivered within the DKE/DIN or CEN/CENELEC open-source initiatives.
Furthermore, a brief summary of open-source licences which might be
suitable within these initiatives is given. 


**This document is for further in-depth discussion only.**

Including Metadata 
===================

For organising the software projects knowledge of appropriate metadata
is essential. Thus, every accepted project must have a file with these
data at it root directory. The file must follow the following naming
convention:

&lt;project\_name&gt;.description

The job of the \*.description file is to store important metadata about
your package. The concept is based on R’s description files and on
Debian’s[^1] control files (DCF, Debian control format).

A flaw of Debian’s and R’s description file is that they use a flat data
structure. In order to catch up with the concepts of Smart Industry a
data structure the ini-file-format is used. This guarantees the biggest
intersection between human-readability and a minimal hierarchical data
structure. The following example shows the content of a minimal
description file:

```
[Package]
Package = mypackage
Title = What The Package Does (one line, title case required)
Version = 0.1
Authors = John Doe; aut; jdoe@north.pol
   Erika Mustermann; cre; mustermann@north.pol
Description = What the package does (one paragraph)
License = GPL-3
```


The ini-file structure was chosen because all modern programming
languages and tools have well introduced libraries for parsing and
processing files. Therefore, ini-files can be exported to xml, json or
other formats on the fly. Thus, the link to the “asset administration
shell” and the Industrie 4.0 concepts is easily to achieve.

Structure of description-files
------------------------------

\*.description-files use the simple ini file format. The
\*.description-file is human-readable and text-based. It has a content
with a structure and syntax comprising key–value pairs for properties,
and sections that organize the properties.

#### Sections

Sections are introduced by section identifiers. Section names must be
surrounded by brackets (\[\]). Whitespaces before the section identifier
are ignored. Furthermore, whitespaces before and after brackets are
ignored as well.

Example:

```
[Section]
; a valid section

[Section 1]
; This is section >Section 1<

[section]
; Note the capitalisation, this is section >section<
; and not >Section<

[ section-2 ]
; This is >section-2<
; trailing/ leading spaces are ignored.

; [ section-3 ]
; No section, only a comment
```


#### Entries

Entries are described by a key identifier and the assigned entry.
Identifier are separated by an equal sign (=). Whitespaces before the
key identifier are ignored. Furthermore, whitespaces before and after
the equal sign are ignored as well. Key names are shall not contain
line-wraps or equal signs:

Example:

```
Entry-1=A valid entry
Entry-2 = Also valid
   Entry-3 = Still valid
Entry 4 = Also valid -> Key name is >Entry 4<
; Entry-5 = But this is a comment
Entry-5 This is garbage, cannot handled.
```



#### Case sensitivity

Section and property names (keys) are *case sensitive*.

Example:


```
[section 1]
entry-1 = A valid entry
Entry-1 = entry-1 is not Entry-1
; section1 is not Section1

[Section 1]
entry-2 = A valid entry
Entry-2 = Also valid
```



##### Comments

Semicolons (;) and number signs (\#) a at the beginning of the line
indicate a comment. Comment lines are ignored.

Example:


```
; this is a comment
# this too!
entry = content ;this is not a comment
; The key entry will hold the entry:  >content ;this is not a comment<
```



#### Multi lines

Content spreading more than one line is indicated by a tabulator at the
beginning of the line.

Example:

```
Description = The description of a package is usually long and
   spanning multiple lines. The second and subsequent lines
   must be indented with a tab.
```


#### Mandatory entries

The following entries are mandatory for every \*.description file and
must be included in the mandatory \[Package\] section.

  Entry         Description                     Type
  ------------- ------------------------------- ---------------------------------------
  Package       project name                    string / one line
  Title         short title of the project      string / one line
  Version       version number of the project   multiple integers / separated by dots
  Authors       authors and contributors        string / one line
  Description   short description               string / multiple lines
  Licence       licencing model                 string / one line

##### Package

The entry field holds the project name:

```
Package = My\_First\_Project
```

##### Title

A descriptive title of the project:

```
Title = This is my first project
```

• The description field describes in one line what the project does.
• It must be plain text (no markup),
• It is recommended not to in a period and to limit it to 65 characters.

##### Description

The Description entry is more detailed than the title. If the
description spans multiple lines the following lines must start with a
tab.

Example:

```
Description = The description of a package is usually long and
  spanning multiple lines. The second and subsequent lines
  must be indented with a tab.
```


The description must not include mark up. A more structured description
including mark up can be delivered in the form of manuals or
readme-files.

##### Version

The version of a project is a subsequent sequence of integer values
separated by a dot (.). For example, 1.0 and 0.9.1.10 are valid
versions, but 1.2-3 or 1.0-devel are not. A hierarchy level of 3 is
recommended but not limited in either way. For example, a package might
have a version 1.9. This version number is considered to be the same as
1.9.0 or 1.9.0.0, less than version 1.9.2 or 1.9.0.9, and all of these
are less than version 1.10 (which is version “one point ten”, not “one
point one zero”). The version number of the project must increase with
subsequent releases of a package, but it is more than just an
incrementing counter – the way the number changes with each release can
convey information about what kind of changes are in the project.

Best practices:

-   A released version number consists of three
    numbers, &lt;major&gt;.&lt;minor&gt;.&lt;patch&gt;. For version
    number 1.9.2, 1 is the major number, 9 is the minor number, and 2 is
    the patch number. Versions like 1.0 should be avoided, instead
    always three components (1.0.0) are preferred.

-   An in-development project may have a fourth component: the
    development version. For example, the first version of the package
    should be 0.0.0.1.

The best practices are bases on the Semantic Versioning and by the X.Org
versioning schemes and R’s versioning. Differences are in the numbering
of in-development projects.

##### Authors

To identify the package’s authors and contributors the Author entry is
to be used.

For example:


```
Authors = John Doe; aut; jdoe@north.pol
   Erika Mustermann; cre; mustermann@north.pol
   Erika Mustermann; aut; mustermann@north.pol
```


The entry field consists of three subentries separated by semicolons
(;):

-   Name (given and family)

In most European cultures, given (first name) comes before family (last
name). In many cultures, this convention does not hold.

-   Shortcut of the role

If persons have multiple roles a complete entry for this role must exist
(see example above).

The role is abbreviated by a three-letter code specifying the role.
There are four important roles:

-   cre: the creator or maintainer, the person you should bother if you
    have problems.

-   aut: authors, those who have made significant contributions to
    the package.

-   ctb: contributors, those who have made smaller contributions,
    like patches.

-   cph: copyright holder. This is used if the copyright is held by
    someone other than the author, typically a company (i.e., the
    author’s employer).

A comprehensive list of all possible roles can be found at [^2]

-   Email address Email addresses are optional, but one address must be
    given at least.

If multiple persons are involved each person is written in its own line
with a starting tab.

Every project must have at least one author (aut) and one maintainer
(cre) (they might be the same person). The creator must have an email
address.

##### Licence

The License entry must be either a standard abbreviation for an
open-source license, like GPL-2 or BSD (see Annex 1). The licensing
entry is based on[^3].

A license must be given before the project is hosted. Due to charter of
the DKE/DIN and CEN/CENELEC open-source initiative only open-source
licences are possible.

Open-source software licensing is a rich and complex field. For proposed
projects, the following licences are preferred:

-   Apache 2.0
-   3-clause BSD
-   EPL
-   CC-BY-SA 4.0 (für Dokumente)
-   CERN-OHL (für OS Hardware)

Nevertheless, other licences are possible if they are listed in the
Annex 1.

If the project is licenced under multiple licences the abbreviations
must be separated by semicolons (;).

Example:

```
License = GPL-3
```
