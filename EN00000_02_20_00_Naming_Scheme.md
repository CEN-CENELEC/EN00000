Naming Scheme
=============

***[Back to Start Page](EN00000_00_00_00_Start.md)***

To set up a new repository (project) on CEN/CENELCâ€™s open source repository the following naming convention must be use.

Proposed scheme
---------------

```
<standard name>__<arbitrary_project_title>
```

- All spaces replaced by underscores
- Standard name and project title separated by two underscores  

E.g.:

```
EN_01234__Dummy_Project
```

See demos at: [https://github.com/DIN-DKE?tab=repositories]

Files within the repository can be given any name.


Execption
---------

The mandatory file containing the project metadata must follow the above rule:


```
<standard name>__<arbitrary_project_title>.ini
```

For example:


```
EN_01234__Dummy_Project.ini
```



(see [Metadata](EN00000_02_10_00_Metadata.md))
