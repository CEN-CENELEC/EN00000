Basic Formatting on GitHub
--------------------------


GitHub uses Markdown as easy-to-read, easy-to-write syntax for formatting plain text files. 
Basic information can be found at 
[Link](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).

If you want to convert other file formats to Markup then [pandoc]( https://github.com/jgm/pandoc) is your friend.
